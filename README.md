# About 

An attempt to harness the power of Deep Learning to come up with a solution that can let us detect various classes of activities an infant, toddler or a baby is performing in real-time. This POC can then be published as an end-to-end deployable cloud project.

The model does not restrict predictions for babies only, it is applicable to all entities that appears in a human posture. So temporary, this needs to be handled at project level.

 Special thanks to [nicknochnack/ActionDetectionforSignLanguage](https://github.com/nicknochnack/ActionDetectionforSignLanguage) repository for putting up such helpful content. Without it this project might have never existed.

## Data collection
Data was collected from YouTube video clips. Human pose keypoints were extracted with the help of [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/).

## Classes trained
1. Baby Walking
2. Baby Still (no movement, can be considered as sleeping)
3. Baby Crawling

# Install

Create a new environment and use below command for installing all required packages

```bash
pip install -r- requirements.txt
```

# Run Predictions

1. Rename your baby video as input.mp4 and place it inside ```/raw``` directory.
2. Open cmd and traverse to the project directory.
3. To run the prediction script, just do:

```bash
python prediction.py 
```
